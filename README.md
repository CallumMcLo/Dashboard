# Dashboard

#Issue identified:
The underlying issue I uncovered was that there was no central way to find information, you had to log into everything manually taking up time and effort in order to gain access to specific information, ideas relating to a dashboard fixes this, but there is none catered to this specific issue of logging into school websites/mail etc to get information like notices and their timetable or their emails.
